## Multi-Agent System using LangGraph

This project implements a **multi-agent system** using **LangGraph**, enabling seamless collaboration between multiple AI agents to solve complex tasks. Each agent specializes in different functionalities, working together in a structured conversational flow to achieve specific goals. The system leverages **LangChain** for efficient agent orchestration and **graph-based execution** for optimized decision-making.  

### Features:  
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Agents interact and share information dynamically.  
- **Graph-Based Execution**: Utilizes **LangGraph** to manage task flow efficiently.  
- **Customizable Agent Roles**: Define and modify agents based on project needs.  
- **Scalability & Modularity**: Easily extend or integrate new agents into the system.  

This project is ideal for **task automation, decision-making systems, and AI-driven workflows** that require multiple agents working in coordination. ðŸš€
